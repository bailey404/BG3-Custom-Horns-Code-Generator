# BG3 Custom Horns Code Generator
 A tool designed to assist with the creation of the code blocks necessary for implementing custom horn mods in the game Baldur's Gate 3. This new and updated version is able to create the code for custom horns on all available races, providing you have all the necessary model files.

An instructional README file is in the works; in the meantime, most of the question mark hover helps do work, save for the newly-implemented Auto-Populate. I'm still working on getting this a little more polished and easier to use/understand, I'm just most interested in getting functionality hammered out first!
